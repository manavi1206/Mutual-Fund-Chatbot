Changes in asset allocation pattern/Portfolio Rebalancing:
Short Term Defensive Consideration:
Subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations the asset allocation pattern indicated above may change from time to time,
keeping in view market conditions, market opportunities, applicable regulations and political and economic
factors. It must be clearly understood that the percentages stated above are only indicative and not absolute
and that they can vary substantially depending upon the perception of the Investment Manager, the intention
being at all times to seek to protect the interests of the Unit holders. As per clause 1.14.1.2.b of Master
Circular, as may be amended from time to time, such changes in the investment pattern will be for short term
and for defensive consideration only.
In the event of change in the asset allocation, the fund manager will carry out portfolio rebalancing within 30
calendar days or such other timeline as may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time.
Portfolio rebalancing (in case of passive breaches):
As per clause 2.9 of Master Circular, as may be amended/ clarified from time to time, in the event of change
in the asset allocation due to passive breaches (occurrence of instances not arising out of omission and
commission of the AMC), the fund manager is required to carry out portfolio rebalancing within 30 Business
Days.
In case the portfolio is not rebalanced within the period of 30 Business days, justification in writing, including
details of efforts taken to rebalance the portfolio shall be placed before the Investment Committee. The
Investment Committee, if it so desires, can extend the timeline for rebalancing up to sixty (60) Business days

requirements specified under the aforesaid circular including reporting the deviation to Trustees at each
stage.

13
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
For detailed disclosures, kindly refer Section II.
C. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?
The investment objective of the Scheme is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing
predominantly in Large-Cap companies.
The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large- Cap stocks. The Scheme may also invest
upto 20% of AUM in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors
and economic variables.
The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and
subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.
Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities.
Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook.
The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)
Regulations.
As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and
options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under
applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as
permitted by the regulations.
For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘Where
will the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A
Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the
AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.
No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.
Risk Control
Investments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and
provisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would
incorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control
process involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this
diversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use
various derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,
with an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures
are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would
be completely eliminated.
PORTFOLIO TURNOVER
The Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an
endeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of
subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable
measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage
and transaction cost.
14
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
D. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?
NIFTY 100 Total Returns Index (TRI)
As required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those
notified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the
category of the scheme.
NIFTY 100 is a diversified 100 stock index representing major sectors of the economy. This index intends to
measure the performance of large market capitalisation companies. The performance will be benchmarked
to the Total Returns Variant of the Index.
The Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from
time to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to
SEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.

PART III. OTHER DETAILS
A. COMPUTATION OF NAV
Methodology for Computation of NAV:
The Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme
by the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its
investments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or
such norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and
Procedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website.
In case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI,
the Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail.
NAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below:
20
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
Market or Fair Value of the Scheme’s Investments
+ Current Assets
NAV (Rs.) - Current Liabilities and Provisions
= _______________________________________________
per Unit
No. of Units outstanding under the
Scheme/Plan
The NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day.
Separate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto
3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals.
Illustration for Computation of NAV:
NAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below:
Particulars Amount (In INR)
Assets
Investments (at Market Value) 10,000
(Equity/Debt/Derivatives)
Current Assets
Interest receivable 1,000
Dividend Receivables 550

Total Assets (A) 13,050
Current Liabilities
Trade Payables 1,500
Expense Payable 25
Dividend payable 25
Total Liabilities (B) 1,550
Net Assets (C) (A – B) 11,500
Units Outstanding (D) 1,000
NAV per unit (C/D) ₹ 11.50
METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE
21
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
• Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund)
by investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in):
The Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV.
i.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV
For a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will
be:
= 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount)
11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV)
= 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals)
Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above
illustration.
• Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch-outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by
investors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs):
The Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%).
i.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load).
For a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be:
= 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%)
= 12.1234 - 0.1212
= Rs. 12.0022
Therefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be -
= 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price)
= Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals)
Charges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above
illustration.
While determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open
ended scheme is not lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value.
For other details such as policies with respect to computation of NAV, rounding off, investment in foreign
securities, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc. refer to SAI.

working days prior to the effective date of the change and update the TER under the Section titled “Statutory
Disclosures” under sub-section titled “Total Expense Ratio of Mutual Fund Schemes”.
Illustration: Impact of Expense Ratio on Scheme's return:
Expense ratio, normally expressed as a percentage of Average Assets under Management, is calculated by
dividing the permissible expenses under the Regulations by the average net assets.
To further illustrate in rupee terms the above, for the Scheme under reference, suppose an Investor invested
Rs. 10,000/- (after deduction of stamp duty, if any) under the Growth Option, the impact of expenses charged
will be as under:
Particulars Regular Plan Direct Plan
Amount invested at the beginning of the year (Rs.) 10,000 10,000
Returns before expenses (Rs.) 1,500 1,500
Expenses other than Distribution expenses (Rs.) 150 150
Distribution expenses (Rs.) 50 0
Returns after expenses at the end of the year (Rs.) 1300 1350
Returns (in %) 13% 13.5%
Note(s):
● The purpose of the above illustration is purely to explain the impact of expense ratio charged to the Plan(s)
under the Scheme and should not be construed as providing any kind of investment advice or guarantee
of returns on investments.
● It is assumed that the expenses charged are evenly distributed throughout the year.
● The expenses of the Direct Plan of the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses/
commission
25
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
● Any tax impact has not been considered in the above example, in view of the individual nature of the tax
implications. Each investor is advised to seek appropriate advice.
C. LOAD STRUCTURE
Exit Load is an amount which is paid by the investor to redeem the units from the scheme. Load amounts are
variable and are subject to change from time to time. For the current applicable structure, please refer to the
website of the AMC (www.hdfcfund.com) or you may call at 1800 3010 6767/1800 419 7676 or your
distributor.
Type of Load Load chargeable (as %age of NAV)
Exit Load - In respect of each purchase / switch-in of Units, an Exit Load of 1.00% is payable
if Units are redeemed/ switched-out within 1 year from the date of allotment.
- No Exit Load is payable if Units are redeemed / switched-out after 1 year from the
date of allotment.
No Entry Load will be charged.
(i) No Exit Load shall be levied for switching between Plans / Options within the Scheme. However, exit load
will be applicable if the units are switched-out / redeemed from the Scheme within the exit load period
from the initial date of purchase.
(ii) No Exit load will be levied on bonus Units and on units allotted on Re-investment of Income Distribution
cum Capital Withdrawal.
(iii) No Exit load will be levied on Units allotted in the Target Scheme under the Transfer of Income Distribution
cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan Facility (TIP Facility).
(iv) In case of Systematic Transactions such as Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), Flex Systematic
Investment Plan (Flex SIP), Systematic Transfer Plan (STP), HDFC Flex Systematic Transfer Plan
(Flex STP), HDFC Swing Systematic Transfer Plan (Swing STP), HDFC Flexindex Plan (Flexindex)
etc., Exit Load, if any, prevailing on the date of registration / enrolment shall be levied.
The AMC/ Trustee if it so deems fit in the interest of smooth and efficient functioning of the Mutual Fund
reserves the right to introduce/modify the Load Structure depending upon the circumstances prevailing at
that time subject to maximum limits as prescribed under the SEBI (MF) Regulations. While determining the
price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open ended scheme is not
lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value. Exit load (net of GST) charged, if any, shall be credited to the
Scheme. The investor is requested to check the prevailing load structure of the Scheme before investing.

SECTION II
I. INTRODUCTION
A. DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION
Visit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures
B. RISK FACTORS
■ Scheme Specific Risk Factors:
Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following:
(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments
● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis.
Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should
not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.
● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger
amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such
securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.
● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these
investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme
incurring losses till the security is finally sold.
● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the
debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.
(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities
• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market
instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme
is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase
in the level of interest rates.
• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may
restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security
is finally sold.
• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of
the issuers.
• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of
an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which
may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in
economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions
specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit
quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will
endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.
• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities
before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment
may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,
resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.
• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the
securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the "interest on
27
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
interest" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be
lower than that originally assumed.
• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and
such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems
in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are
uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities
purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment
opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the
absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in
potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in
the Scheme's portfolio.
• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income
security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest
rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing
coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of
interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels
at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government
Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the
sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by
movement in interest rates in the financial system.
• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme
Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may
increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level
of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are
comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.
• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated
securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may
increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.
• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these
securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.
Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in
zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero
coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic
payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current
interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount
depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.
It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived
credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than
the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.
• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate
or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange
(“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and
greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid
secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in
unlisted securities at a fair value.
• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than
rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such investments
display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic
environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities
tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.

(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated
securities
The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the
risk factors associated with debt instruments.
• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement
for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and
could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity
could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit
enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges,
etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by
hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables
etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the
issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan
pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.
• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit
enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit
enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the
market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence,
lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments
and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.
• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength
of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could
have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to
inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the
underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk
of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore,
apart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit
risk.
(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo
The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing
Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party
Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL;
Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments.
The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the
default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in
case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL).
As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default
fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's
contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-
defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution
being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is
allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting
member).
CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to
meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for
meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is
exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of
29
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result
the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund.
(v) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities
● Currency Risk:
Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets
of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee
equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value
of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.
● Interest Rate Risk:
The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ
significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to
their interest rate cycles.
● Credit Risk:
Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and
principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is
substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with
rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency.
● Taxation Risk:
In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI)
under section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges
based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher
level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.
The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its
investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing /
evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a
higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its
NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.
● Legal and Regulatory Risk:
Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it.
If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should
be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ
materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the
investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively.
● Country Risk:
The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk
encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect
foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction
of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of
the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of
trades or otherwise.
● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use
derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may
be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.
• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:
30
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory
bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas
Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.
(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives
● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt
to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized
instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with
stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument
but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability
of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.
● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as
disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund
manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the
fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No
assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies.
● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks
associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
● Credit Risk:
The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and
is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction.
● Market Risk:
Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.
● Illiquidity risk:
This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of
liquidity in the market.
Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures
(IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used
to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the
gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.
(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares
● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of
Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference
shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits
in any year.
● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we
may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.
● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and
unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital
erosion in case the company goes into liquidation.
(viii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending
As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the
risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the
agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.
31
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,
the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible
loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved
intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity
& loss of opportunity.
(ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt
The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent
that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.
● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk
There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the
ability of the investor to resell them.
● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk
The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates
represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation
of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and
Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors'
Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the
Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the
amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent
default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However,
many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required
to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may
be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.
● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs
In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge
Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).
● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility
If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could
experience losses or delays in the payments.
● Risk of Co-mingling
With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the
Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing
the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the
form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from
other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors,
the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss.
(x) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)
Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile.
Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital
Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for
issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The
instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated
with these instruments are highlighted below:
Key Risk Factors:
32
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
- Risk on coupon servicing
Banks
As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/
payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses
or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of
coupons.
NBFCs
While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be
deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios.
Corporates
Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually
cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI.
- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity
Banks
As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-
1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further,
AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in
the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank
is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds
or a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector
injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.
- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer
Banks
The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the
date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the
call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call
exercise date.
NBFCs
The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the
regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.
However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments
for a period beyond the first call exercise date.
Corporates
There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option,
the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date.
(xi) Risk factors associated with Short Selling
Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he
borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and
returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock
33
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price
and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short
positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price
increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.
(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:
● Price Risk:
Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis
owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market
conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of
interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.
● Interest Rate Risk:
Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,
prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.
● Credit Risk:
Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or
even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are
likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.
● Liquidity Risk:
This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no
assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time
when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a
discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As
these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk.
● Reinvestment Risk:
Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be
repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc. Consequently,
the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.
● Legal and Regulatory Risk
The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises
a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators
and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations
or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole.
Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will
impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively
or make distributions.
(xiii) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes
1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any
change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the
performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.
2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.
34
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
(xiv) General Risk factors
• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments
made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods
and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt
of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of
various factors that affect the capital markets in general.
• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes
and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in
the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view
of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending
redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption
and / or Suspend Redemption of the units.
• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest
in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash
or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to
substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments
in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements.
• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the
portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period.
• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may
include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.
• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability
mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities
leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.
C. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments
• The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large-Cap stocks. These stocks are
characterised by a high level of trading volumes imparting relatively high liquidity to the portfolio.
• Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio
comprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration
risk and sector specific risks.
• Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk,
interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
Credit Evaluation Policy
The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment
opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,
quality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized
rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually
in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.
In line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for
investments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters
for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in
their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been
35
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board
of AMC and Trustee shall be sought.
Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at
prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market
instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other
instruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid
compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk
based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating
portfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund
objectives, regulations and investment strategy.
Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,
credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment
strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be
undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors
(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate
diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment
strategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for
the purpose.
Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing
and hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre
approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision
clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other
derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.
Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market
yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher
duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall
strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions
/ outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable
regulations.
Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification
across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and
applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular
industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific
risk.
Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares:
Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer
will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative
factors (parentage, track record etc.).
Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have
relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of
secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required.
Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while
assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing.
Risk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI):
36
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
• Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity
Banks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain
extent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence,
an in-depth credit evaluation of each bank is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage,
profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).
Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable
surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed.
Investment is done only in the AT-1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This,
in turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV.
Risk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.
• Risk on coupon servicing
NBFCs
These risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the
required regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in
mind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors
(parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track
record of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to
infuse capital, in case it is needed.
Corporates
To mitigate this risk, an in-depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both
quantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage,
track record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is
restricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company
has adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs.
• Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer
Banks
While the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian
banks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of
the investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as
we invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising
the call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise
can lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond
tenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently
managing the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks
would choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they
have done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date
(say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond
on any of the subsequent annual call options dates.
NBFCs and Corporates
While the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step-up usually
provides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound
credit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the
call as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise
can lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors)
and impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual
37
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
instrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor
for extended holding period.
While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance
that these risks would be completely eliminated.

• Investment in Securitised Debt
A securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance
company, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle
(SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),
the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling
his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the
underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,
the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency
for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.
Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:
● Commercial vehicles
● Auto and two wheeler pools
● Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)
● Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans
● Corporate loans/receivables
Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy
1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme
The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the
same level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of
similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional
credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to
maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk
profile of the Scheme.
2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier
securitised debt, etc
The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially
provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in
securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A
detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator
on various parameters given below:
● Track record
The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and
capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience
of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the
company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc.
● Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc.
Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately
cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as
indicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the
portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class.
● Ability to pay
The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with
strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management
system of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong
asset portfolio.
● Business Risk Assessment
41
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit
assessment wherein following factors are also considered:
- Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)
- Outlook for the industry
- Company specific factors
In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with
the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into
account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions)
regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below:
● Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants
● High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis
as well on a consolidated level/ group level
● Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be
● Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be
● Poor reputation in market
● Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be.
3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator
Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with
such investment:
a. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator
b. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal
loans etc.
c. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism
d. Quality of MIS
e. Credit cum liquidity enhancement
f. Credit appraisal norms of originator
g. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels
h. Past performance of rated pools
i. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc.
4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for
less diversified investments
Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new,
used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium
enterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical
distribution.
Risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of
credit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.

Information in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the
change in related factors.
Notes:
A. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the
underlying borrower is considered.
B. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis.
In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following
factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting
the pool)
• Size of the loan
• Average original maturity of the pool
• Loan to Value Ratio
• Average seasoning of the pool
• Default rate distribution
• Geographical Distribution
• Credit enhancement facility
• Liquid facility
• Structure of the pool
5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation
The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table
(Refer Point 4).
Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in
the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally
varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset.
6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised
43
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator
through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5%
to 10%.
7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of
an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund
All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several
parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating
of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised
debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that
scheme.
8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring
investment in securitised debt (in general)
Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various
parameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit
enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees
and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by
the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the
same.
Trading in Derivatives
• The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines
provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme.
• The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses
may arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the
underlying cash instruments held by the Scheme.
• The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative
instruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time.

interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below:
(Portfolio Modified Duration*
Market Value of the Portfolio)
(Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR)
ii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the
existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging.
iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto
maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following:
a) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average

(excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge.
In case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be rebalanced
within 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for
hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of
Master Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days.
Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using
IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be
complied with:
i. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or
ii. The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged
portions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more

The following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended March 31, 2025 on some of
the instruments. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as
interest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy.

These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep
changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. The price and yield on various
debt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate,
overall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity
profile, credit risk etc.
Generally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher
than the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread,
depends on the credit rating of the entity.
• Overseas Debt Market
The nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of
diverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well
developed.
Investment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted
to the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi-
government and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since
these are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple
benefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency
movements.
49
HDFC Large Cap Fund-SID
Investments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the
Yen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial
centres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of
instruments.
Besides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by
a number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest
rates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major
currencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.
