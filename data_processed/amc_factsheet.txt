outlook. This was a departure from recent resolution that the monetary policy had
limited space to support growth. This clearly indicates RBI would be open to cut rates
further to support growth especially amid tariff and trade related uncertainties. This
was also indicated in its projections for inflation and growth. While the inflation
forecast was lowered across, GDP growth projections were increased only to adjust
for higher-than-expected Q1FY26 growth rate. GDP growth rate from Q3FY26 to
Q1FY27 was lowered by 10-20bps.

Market Review
In our view, RBI is likely to lower rates further as trade and tariff related uncertainties Glossary
drag growth down and outlook for inflation is favourable due to cut in GST rates and
favourable food inflation outlook AE Advanced Economies
Therefore, in our view, medium term outlook on Indian fixed income market remains BoE Bank of England
favourable, considering: BoJ Bank of Japan
• Headline CPI inflation is likely to significantly undershoot RBI target of 4% in BoP Balance of Payment
FY26. Thereafter too the rise due to unfavourable base is likely to be contained. bps Basis points
• RBI likely to keep liquidity in surplus through measures such as OMOs which BE Budget Estimates
will help in better transmission to lower rates CAGR Compound Annual Growth Rate

Overall, in our view, yields are likely to remain rangebound with a downward bias. GST Goods and Services Tax
Falling inflation, front loading of policy rate cuts and indication by RBI that further GVA Gross Value Added
space has opened to support growth is positive from yields perspective. Furthermore, IMD India Meteorological Department
lower than expected SDL borrowings in Q3, Central Government’s reduction of supply INR Indian Rupee
for long dated securities in H2 and transmission of past rate cuts also bodes well for IMF International Monetary Fund
yields. There is a likelihood that RBI will have to conduct OMOs towards the end of IMPS Immediate Payment System
this fiscal to maintain adequate liquidity which is also positive from yields perspective. JGB Japanese Government Bonds
Thus, in view of comfortable liquidity and attractive corporate bonds spreads (over
LCV Light Commercial Vehicle
Gsec), one may consider investment in medium duration (schemes with duration of
Mbpd Million Barrels Per Day
upto 5 years) categories especially corporate bonds focussed funds, in line with
MHCV Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle
individual risk appetite. Further, as long bond spreads over 10 year G-secs remain
elevated and given that Government has cut supply at the longer end in its 2HFY26 MIBOR Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate
borrowing program, investors with a relatively longer investment horizon could M-o-M Month on Month
continue with their allocation to longer duration funds in line with individual risk MPC Monetary Policy Committee

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. Scheme performance may not
strictly be comparable with that of its Additional Benchmark in view of balanced nature of the scheme where a portion of
scheme’s investments are made in debt instruments. $$ All Distributions declared prior to the splitting of the Scheme into
IDCW & Growth Options are assumed to be reinvested in the units of the Scheme at the then prevailing NAV (ex-distribution
NAV). As NIFTY 50 TRI data is not available since inception of the scheme, additional benchmark performance is calculated
using composite CAGR of NIFTY 50 PRI values from February 1, 1994 to June 29, 1999 and TRI values since June 30, 1999. For
performance of other schemes managed by Gopal Agrawal, Srinivasan Ramamurthy, Arun Agarwal, Nandita Menezes & Anil
Bamboli, please refer page 101. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The
expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in
the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 106 to 112.

into consideration for computation of performance.
Note: @@Effective close of business hours of June 1, 2018, HDFC Prudence Fund merged with HDFC Growth Fund (HDFC
Balanced Advantage Fund after changes in fundamental attributes). As the portfolio characteristics and the broad investment
strategy of HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund is similar to that of erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund, the track record (i.e. since
inception date, dividend history, etc.) and past performance of erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund has been considered, in line with
SEBI circular on Performance disclosure post consolidation/ merger of scheme dated April 12, 2018.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. The Scheme formerly, a debt
oriented hybrid fund, has undergone change in Fundamental attributes w.e.f. May 23, 2018 and become a multi asset fund
investing in e uities, debt and gold related instruments. Accordingly, the Scheme’s benchmar has also changed. Hence, the
performance of the Scheme from inception till May 22, 2018 may not strictly be comparable with those of the new benchmark
and the additional benchmark. Scheme performance may not strictly be comparable with that of its Additional Benchmark in
view of hybrid nature of the scheme where a portion of scheme’s investments are made in debt instruments and gold related
instruments. For performance of other schemes managed by Srinivasan Ramamurthy, Anil Bamboli, Bhagyesh Kagalkar, Arun
Agarwal & Nandita Menezes, please refer page 101. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense
structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses /
commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 106 to 112.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken
into consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged

circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.

This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). N.A. Not Available. For performance of other schemes
managed by Anupam Joshi & Praveen Jain, please refer page 101. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a
different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution
expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 106 to 112.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken
into consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). For performance of other schemes managed by Anil
Bamboli, please refer page 101. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The
expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in
the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 106 to 112.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken
into consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). For performance of other schemes managed by Shobhit
Mehrotra, please refer page 101. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses
of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular
Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 106 to 112.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken
into consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked
to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with
derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the
( ) volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are
recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when
deciding to make their investments

allotment price) For performance of other schemes managed by Shobhit Mehrotra, please refer page 101. Different plans viz.
Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower
to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page
106 to 112.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken
into consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR) For performance of other schemes managed by Anupam
Joshi, please refer page 101. Different plans viz. Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of
the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular
Plan. For Performance of Direct Plan, refer page 106 to 112.
Note: Effective close of business hours of May 8, 2018, HDFC Medium Term Opportunities Fund (HMTOF) underwent changes in
Fundamental Attributes and was renamed as HDFC Corporate Bond Fund (HCBF) and HDFC Floating Rate Income Fund – Long
Term Plan and HDFC Gilt Fund – Short Term Plan were merged therein. As the portfolio structuring of HCBF closely resembles
the erstwhile HMTOF, the past performance of HMTOF is provided, in line with SEBI circular on Performance disclosure post
consolidation/ merger of scheme dated April 12, 2018.
^Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Load is not taken
into consideration for computation of performance.
This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market
circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate
due diligence when deciding to make their investments

This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is
linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged
with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances
the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are
recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when
deciding to make their investments

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended schemes is primarily buy and
hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed
Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Different plans viz.
Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the
Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available For Riskometer of the Schemes and Benchmark's, refer page 115 to 129.

Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Different plans viz.
Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the
Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available For Riskometer of the Schemes and Benchmark's, refer page 115 to 129.

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended schemes is primarily buy and
hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed
Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Different plans viz.
Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the
Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available For Riskometer of the Schemes and Benchmark's, refer page 115 to 129.

Performance of close-ended schemes, being close-ended in nature, is not strictly comparable with that of open-ended schemes since the investment strategy for close-ended schemes is primarily buy and
hold whereas open-ended schemes are actively managed
Past performance may or may not be sustained in future and is not a guarantee of any future returns. Returns greater than 1 year period are compounded annualized (CAGR). Different plans viz.
Regular Plan and Direct Plan have a different expense structure. The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses / commission charged in the
Regular Plan. Load is not taken into consideration for computation of performance. N.A.: Not Available For Riskometer of the Schemes and Benchmark's, refer page 115 to 129.
