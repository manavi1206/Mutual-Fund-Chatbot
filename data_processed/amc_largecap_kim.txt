Portfolio rebalancing (in case of passive breaches):
As per clause 2.9 of Master Circular, as may be amended/ clarified from time to time, in the event of
change in the asset allocation due to passive breaches (occurrence of instances not arising out of
omission and commission of the AMC), the fund manager is required to carry out portfolio rebalancing
within 30 Business Days.
In case the portfolio is not rebalanced within the period of 30 Business days, justification in writing,
including details of efforts taken to rebalance the portfolio shall be placed before the Investment
Committee. The Investment Committee, if it so desires, can extend the timeline for rebalancing up to
sixty (60) Business days from the date of completion of mandated rebalancing period. In case the
portfolio of the scheme is not rebalanced within the aforementioned mandated plus extended
timelines, the AMC shall follow the requirements specified under the aforesaid circular including
reporting the deviation to Trustees at each stage.
7. Investment Strategy
The investment objective of the Scheme is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing
predominantly in Large-Cap companies.
The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large- Cap stocks. The Scheme may
also invest upto 20% of AUM in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain
diversified across key sectors and economic variables.
The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for
diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.
Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock
Lending activities.
Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their
outlook.
The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)
Regulations.
As part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as
futures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible
in future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for
restricted purposes as permitted by the regulations.
For detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer
section ‘Where will the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID.
Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the
AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be
achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.
8. Risk Profile of the Scheme
5
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
Mutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the
SID carefully for details on risk factors before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are
summarized below:
(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments
● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a
daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk
and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.
● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and
carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the
exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.
● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell
these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may
lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.
● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments
held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.
(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities
• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money
Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The
NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be
adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.
• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,
which may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring
losses till the security is finally sold.
• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term
rating of the issuers.
• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.
the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or
any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial
conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes
in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that
may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may
increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit
risk through in-house credit analysis.
• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its
securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of
such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in
securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.
• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received
from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment
is the "interest on interest" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows
can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.
• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement
periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances.
Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods
6
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
when the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The
inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems,
could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to
sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and
liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the
Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the
Scheme's portfolio.
• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed
income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall
and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a
function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level
of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which
government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already
dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It
exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the
sense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced
only by movement in interest rates in the financial system.
• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the
Scheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the
Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g.
corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even
among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated
bonds.
• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated /
unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer
attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.
• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the
security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to
issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The
AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may
increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations
that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a
specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are
generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the
time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It
also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the
perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are
generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.
• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an
associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a
stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price
fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market.
Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance
that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.
• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value
higher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments.
Such investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a
deteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to
be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.
7
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement
(CE) rated securities
The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in
addition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments.
• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit
enhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could
be in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc.
from another entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a
bank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form
of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/
mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan
receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for
CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer
is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan
pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.
• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit
enhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due
to the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities,
the liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar
rated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of
the scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher
impact cost when such instruments are sold.
• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the
combined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the
issuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The
weakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure
due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce
guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases
the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from
issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit
risk.
(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo
The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the
Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government
securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and
settlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks
considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an
amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as
a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any
member in settling transactions routed through CCIL).
As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to
the default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post
utilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default
fund contributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the
8
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any
settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the
residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member).
CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with
a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades
and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo
trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL,
in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default
losses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to
its contribution to the default fund.
(v) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities
● Currency Risk:
Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that
the assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the
Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected
by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.
● Interest Rate Risk:
The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related,
can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the
Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles.
● Credit Risk:
Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet
interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness
of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate
investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by
accredited/registered credit rating agency.
● Taxation Risk:
In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional
Information (SAI) under section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities
poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction.
The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual
taxation.
The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from
its investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the
changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All
these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc.
thus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.
● Legal and Regulatory Risk:
Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely
affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or
regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors
may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and
adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also
be imposed retrospectively.
9
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
● Country Risk:
The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the
risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might
adversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include
events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-
lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax
laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise.
● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund
may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance
with conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.
• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:
In case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by
regulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in
permissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.
(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives
● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in
an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative
products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis
different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an
understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks
include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate
perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.
● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well
as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the
ability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the
strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund
manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will
be able to identify or execute such strategies.
● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the
risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
● Credit Risk:
The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its
obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative
transaction.
● Market Risk:
Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.
● Illiquidity risk:
This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due
to lack of liquidity in the market.
Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate
Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and
the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the
portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.
10
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares
● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of
payment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-
cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference
shares in case of inadequate profits in any year.
● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and
thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.
● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than
secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is
significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation.
(viii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending
As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending,
including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply
with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme
and the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the
collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to
return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits
accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The
scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss
of opportunity.
(ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt
The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not
represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.
● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk
There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This
could limit the ability of the investor to resell them.
● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk
The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These
Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not
represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any
affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate
Holders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause
depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor
Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit
Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to
repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors
may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to
realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold
may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.
● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs
11
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also,
any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates
(PTCs).
● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility
If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor
could experience losses or delays in the payments.
● Risk of Co-mingling
With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the
Obligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by
a Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that
some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the
Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its
capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to
a potential loss.
(x) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)
Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their
capital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for
Basel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are
no regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds
as per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is
no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:
Key Risk Factors:
- Risk on coupon servicing
Banks
As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel
distributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable
reserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow
banks to make payment of coupons.
NBFCs
While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can
also be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of
capital ratios.
Corporates
Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon
is usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon
rate of the PDI.
- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity
Banks
As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity
Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get
12
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
written down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common
equity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV
is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless
there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection
happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital.
This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.
- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer
Banks
The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified
period from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the
bank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the
instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.
NBFCs
The NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as
per the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the
RBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may
have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.
Corporates
There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the
call option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call
exercise date.
(xi) Risk factors associated with Short Selling
Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade.
Instead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the
stock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,
Short seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the
difference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock
appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money
and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall
result into major losses in the portfolio.
(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:
● Price Risk:
Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a
daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in
general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and
Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer
procedures.
13
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
● Interest Rate Risk:
Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates
rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.
● Credit Risk:
Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest
payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of
REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not
necessarily be pre scheduled.
● Liquidity Risk:
This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is
no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there
would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of
illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments
for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be
exposed to liquidity risk.
● Reinvestment Risk:
Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there
could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs,
etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.
● Legal and Regulatory Risk
The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs
comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and
enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast
as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers
of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the
regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply
with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.
(xiii) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes
1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance.
Any change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will
affect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.
2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.
(xiv) General Risk factors
• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the
investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have
different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen
circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the
Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital
markets in general.
• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading
volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units
14
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or
restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole
discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain
circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend
Redemption of the units in the SID.
• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be
able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies
collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities /
investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The
Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity
requirements.
• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance
between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to
medium term period.
• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments,
which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation
policies.
• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-
liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of
the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in
lower yield instruments.
For details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID.
9. Plans/ Options
Plans: Regular & Direct
Regular and Direct Plans offer the following options:
(a) Growth Option
(b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option
Under this Option, it is proposed to declare income / capital Distribution (IDCW) subject to
availability of distributable surplus, as computed in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations.
Investors should note that distributions can be made out of Equalization Reserves (representing
accumulated realized gains), which is part of sale price paid by them.
➢ This Option offers following facilities:
• Payout of IDCW (“Payout”) and
• Re-investment of IDCW (“Re-investment”)
Default Option- Growth
Default Facility- Payout
For detailed disclosure on default plans and options, kindly refer SAI.
10. Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions)
The below cut-off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid
applications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day (During Continuous
Offer Period):
A] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount:
15
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire
amount are available for utilization before the cut-off time i.e. credited to the bank account
of the Scheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable.
● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire
amount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day
or before the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the
cut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be
applicable.
● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are
credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent
Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent
Business Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable.
B] For Switch-ins of any amount:
For determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured:
● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time.
● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are
credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time.
● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time.
● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line
with redemption payouts.
In case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for
the Switch-out scheme. Redemption for switch-out shall be processed at the applicable
NAV as per cut-off timing. Switch-in will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business
Day) based on realization of funds as per the redemption pay-out cycle for the switch-out
scheme.
For investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic Investment Plans
(SIP), Flex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex-STP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income
Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the units will be allotted as
per the closing NAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target
Scheme irrespective of the installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc.
While the AMC will endeavour to deposit the payment instruments accompanying investment
application submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization
of funds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the
banks.
Since different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic
transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may
happen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time
on the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment.
Investors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid
delays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment.
C] For Redemption (including switch-out) applications
● In respect of valid applications received upto 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, same
day's closing NAV shall be applicable.
16
HDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM
● In respect of valid applications received after 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, the
closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable.
Transactions through online facilities / electronic modes:
The time of transaction done through various online facilities / electronic modes offered by the
AMC, for the purpose of determining the applicability of NAV, would be the time when the request
for purchase / sale / switch of units is received in the servers of AMC/RTA.
The AMC has the right to amend cut off timings subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations for the smooth
and efficient functioning of the Scheme.
11. Minimum Application Amount / Number of Units

accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.
IDCW, if declared, will be paid (subject of deduction of tax at source, if any) to those Unitholders /
Beneficial Owners whose names appear in the Register of Unit holders maintained by the Mutual
Fund/ statement of beneficial ownership maintained by the Depositories, as applicable, under the
IDCW option as on the Record Date. The IDCW payment shall be transferred to the Unitholders
within 7 working days of the record date of such declaration of IDCW or such other timeline as may
be specified by SEBI from time to time. In the event of failure to transfer IDCW within the stipulated
period, the AMC shall be liable to pay interest @ 15% per annum to the Unitholders for the delay in
payment as computed from the Record Date or from such other date or for such period as may be
advised by SEBI from time to time. The Trustee/ AMC reserves the right to change the record date
from time to time. However, it must be distinctly understood that the actual declaration of IDCW
and the frequency thereof will inter alia, depend on the availability of distributable surplus as
computed in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. The decision of the Trustee
in this regard shall be final.
