An open ended equity scheme predominantly investing in large cap stocks.
This is a simple and performing scheme which is eligible for distribution by new cadre of distributors.
The Scheme aims to provide long-term capital appreciation. It will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large Cap stocks, as defined by SEBI, which currently are the 100 largest companies in India in terms of full market capitalization.
Generally, large cap companies are well established businesses that are in operation for a longer period of time and are well positioned to absorb business pressures across various market cycles. Due to their size, they also benefit from economies of scale.
The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors and economic variables.
